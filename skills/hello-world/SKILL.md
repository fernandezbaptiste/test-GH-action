description: A simple hello world skill for testing publish workflows
---

When invoked, greet the user with a friendly hello world message. This skill is designed to demonstrate the full end-to-end publishing workflow using the tesslio/publish GitHub Action. It serves as a minimal but functional example of how tiles can be authored, versioned, and automatically published to the Tessl registry whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The skill itself is intentionally simple — it greets the user warmly and introduces them to the concept of tiles, skills, and the Tessl ecosystem. Think of it as the "hello world" of tile development: a starting point for anyone looking to build, test, and ship their own agent skills through a CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions.
