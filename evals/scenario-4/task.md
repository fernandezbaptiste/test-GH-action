# Welcome Page for a Developer Community Site

## Problem/Feature Description

A developer community called "TesslHub" is launching a new website and needs a complete welcome page. When a developer visits for the first time, the page should greet them warmly, adapt to their language preference and local time of day, and help them get started by introducing the platform's core concepts and pointing them toward useful resources. The page should feel personal — ideally using the visitor's name if available — and should serve as both a greeting and a gentle onboarding guide. The community is built around a modular package system where developers share reusable agent capabilities, and the welcome page should introduce newcomers to this ecosystem naturally. The site needs to work for an international audience spanning English, French, Spanish, German, and Japanese speakers.

## Output Specification

Produce the following files:

- `index.html` — the welcome page with embedded or linked JavaScript that handles language selection, time-of-day detection, and personalization.
- `app.js` — the JavaScript logic powering the greeting functionality. Should handle name input, language switching, time-based greeting adaptation, ecosystem introduction, and resource recommendations.
- `config.json` — configuration data for the greeting system (language strings, supported locales, feature flags, etc.).
